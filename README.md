Ziroh Labs is a start-up formed with the core idea of creating privacy-preserving cryptographic systems that can be used en masse. We believe that privacy is a very important requirement and should be adhered to under all circumstances. While the traditional methods of privacy entail an implicit notion of trust to third-party service providers, it is being observed in multiple instances across the globe that such trust, however, does not exist. Ziroh Labs is formed to design systems where implicit trust mechanisms are a thing of the past, and users are endowed with complete controls on what is being shared, used and profiled.

Team @ Ziroh Labs includes people that have decade long experience in designing and implementation of large scale distributed systems and cryptographic mechanisms. The team has developed cryptographic algorithms that allow encryption of data,  at Rest, in Transit and most importantly while data is “Operated On” .  Using this ground breaking encryption techniques, encrypted text, data or numbers are processed in encrypted form and are not required to be decrypted to process. Ziroh Labs techniques are not only production ready but also validated by the strong cryptographic test of randomness, linear and differential cryptanalysis methods. Ziroh Labs is located at Innovation Centre, International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore, India
